# 1732. Find the Highest Altitude

## 題目`easy`

There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of `n + 1` points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point `0` with altitude equal `0`.

You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n` where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between points `i​​​​`​​ and `i + 1` for all `(0 <= i < n)`. Return the _highest altitude_ of a point.

## 範例

```
Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
```

```
Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.
```

## 限制

- n == gain.length
- 1 <= n <= 100
- -100 <= gain[i] <= 100

## 程式碼

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int largestAltitude(std::vector<int>& gain) {
        int highest = 0;
        int currentAltitude = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < gain.size(); i++) {
            currentAltitude += gain[i];
            highest = std::max(highest, currentAltitude);
        }

        return highest;
    }
};
```

## 思路

這題滿簡單的，我只要比較每次相加後的值和當前最高記錄的值誰大，最終輸出答案即可
